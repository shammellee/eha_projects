	| To be eligible to earn additional points, your application must be received by 10/06/2014 and you must charge $5,000 of eligible purchases* during the first 3 months of membership on an eligible Business Gold Rewards Card from American Express OPEN. If your application is not received by 10/06/2014, you will not be eligible for the #{tokens.mrPoints} additional points after $5,000 in purchases in first 3 months offer if your application is approved. American Express reserves the right to modify or revoke offer at any time. You can earn #{tokens.mrPoints} additional points after you spend $5,000 or more in qualifying purchases on your Card within your first 3 months of Card Membership starting from the date your account is received. In rare instances, your period to spend $5,000 may be shorter than 3 months if there is a delay in receiving your Card. Also, purchases may fall outside of the 3 month period in some cases, such as a delay in merchants submitting transactions to us or if the purchase date differs from the date you made the transaction. (For example, if you buy goods online, the purchase date may be the date the goods are shipped). The #{tokens.mrPoints} additional points will be credited to your Membership Rewards account 6-8 weeks after you have met the purchase requirement. For questions regarding your Card account, please call the number on the back of your Card. Qualifying purchases can be made by the Basic Card Member and any Additional Card Members on a single Card Account. Limit one offer per Card Account. Offer may not be combined with any other special offer. <strong>#{tokens.bonusID}</strong>. Terms and Conditions for the Membership Rewards&reg; program apply.

	| The OPEN Savings benefit is built into Business Cards from American Express OPEN and provides either up to a 10% discount <strong class='textUnderline'>or</strong> up to 4 additional Membership Rewards&reg; points for each eligible dollar spent at OPEN Savings merchants. To take advantage of this benefit, payment must be made with a Business Card from American Express OPEN at the time of purchase. All Cards under a particular Business Card Account (including the Basic Card as well as any Additional or Employee Cards) are combined for the purposes of calculating OPEN Savings benefits. All OPEN Savings benefits are credited to the Basic Card Member only. Please allow up to 12 weeks for your benefit to appear on your monthly statement. If your Card Account is not eligible to receive Membership Rewards points or is not enrolled in the Membership Rewards program, you will receive the OPEN Savings benefit as a discount that will be provided as a statement credit to that Card Account. If your Card Account is enrolled in the Membership Rewards program you have the option of receiving your OPEN Savings benefit either as a discount or as additional Membership Rewards points. The relative value of the benefit options will differ depending on how you use the Membership Rewards points in your account. <span class='textUnderline'>The redemption value of additional points that you receive under the Membership Rewards Points Benefit may be less than the dollar value of statement credits that you receive under the Discount Benefit</span>. You can change your OPEN Savings benefit selection a maximum of once per calendar month. Changes normally take effect within 72 hours from the time you submit a change to your benefit selection. Purchases that are eligible for the OPEN Savings benefit that are returned or credited from an OPEN Savings merchant will result in a reversal of your statement credit or removal of Membership Rewards points depending on your benefit election at the time of the return or credit. The benefit may not be available at all OPEN Savings partner locations. For a full list of individual OPEN Savings merchants and benefit descriptions, please visit <a tabindex='0' href='http://opensavings.com'>opensavings.com</a>.
